### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    What I liked about Lab 1 was that it introduced me to the terminal and
    VScode, with this I was able to write my first line of code. From this
    lab, I was able to learn how to use the Git repository and how to use
    the Git tools. I was able to use the add, commit, and push the file
    containing my code.

* Lab 7

    I enjoyed lab 7, part 2 because I enjoyed using the given images and
    making a strategy on how to implent each restriction. I enjoyed how it
    was a real life example and how I could see it be implemented in a city. 
    What I learnt from this lab was being able to implement both do-while
    statements and if statements in order to correctly determine if a car
    would be allowed to park. It used both a given day and specific time of day.

* Lab 11

    I enjoyed lab 11, part 2 because I was able to see how a fun simple game
    is made through the views of a computer system and software. What I learnt
    from this was how to code and implement a random number generator to create
    a game. The game was based on the player having to guess a given number
    within 3 attempts.
